## What is it?
I refactored the first challenge website to make it accessible for people with disabilities, as well as added semantic elements and updated logical structure.

## Why was it updated?
To make it more easier to read for other developers and added accessible attributes.

## What changed?
Multiple "div" elements were updated to more specific semantic tags to sections, such as "header, nav, section, aside, footer". I also added alt descriptions to images and consolidated class attributes.
